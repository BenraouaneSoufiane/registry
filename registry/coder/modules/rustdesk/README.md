> ðŸ“¦ Automatically installs RustDesk (if not present) and launches it with a generated password.

---

## Features

- Installs RustDesk v1.4.0 if it's not already installed
- Generates a random 6-character password on start
- Outputs the RustDesk ID and password
- Automatically launches RustDesk on workspace start
- Provides an external app link to the [RustDesk web client](https://rustdesk.com/web)

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Coder v2.5 or higher
- A workspace agent compatible with Linux and `apt` package manager

---

### Quickstart

Rustdesk module requires root scope (to install rustdesk & execute rustdesk --password "somepassword", because rustdesk cli does not provide a way to get the password else setup in advance)

1. Add the module to your [Coder Terraform workspace](https://registry.coder.com)
2. Include it in your `main.tf`:

```hcl
module "rustdesk" {
  source    = "github.com/your-username/your-module-repo"
  agent_id  = var.agent_id
}
```
Also add this within resource "docker_container" "workspace":
 
```hcl
privileged = true
  user       = "root"
  network_mode = "host"
  ports {
  internal = 21115
  external = 21115
}
ports {
  internal = 21116
  external = 21116
}
ports {
  internal = 21118
  external = 21118
}
ports {
  internal = 21119
  external = 21119
}
```
